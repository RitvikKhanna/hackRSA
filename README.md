# hackRSA
RSA is unbreakable since we cannot factorize it, however given a threshold, we can find all the prime nos. upto that point using prime sieve and then get the factors P & Q for the encryption and hence find the keys.


This is regarding assignment 9 for CMPUT 299, at University Of Alberta submitted by Ritvik Khanna

All the code in the problems folder was given to us, and some of it was taken from http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/ in the download source and other files for this book. As stated in the assignment only necessary changes were made to the program to solve the problems. Except the minor changes made in the program I did not write the rest of the code and is a work of AI Sweigart and was downloaded from the above said website. Some of the files in the Assignment 4 problem folder, were given to me by the CMPUT 299 TA and the CMPUT 299 Professor.
